I'm 25 software developer from Gdańsk, Poland.

I've been creating software since 2009, commercially since 2011.

It's a tech blog mainly about Android, iOS and JavaScript, but keep looking for other interesting stuff.

I'll try to post tips which I find useful and worth to share with the rest of the world :)
