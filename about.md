I'm 25 software developer from Gdańsk, Poland.

I've been creating software since 2009, commercially since 2011.

Right now I'm working in [BrightInventions](http://blog.brightinventions.pl/) which is software house in Gdańsk.

This is a tech blog mainly about Android, iOS and JavaScript, but keep looking for other interesting stuff.

I'll try to post tips which I find useful and worth to share with the rest of the world.
