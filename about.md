My name is Mateusz Klimek I'm software developer who currently lives in Manchester, UK.

I've been creating software since 2009, commercially since 2011.

This is a tech blog mainly about Android, iOS and JavaScript, but keep looking for other interesting stuff.

I'll try to post tips which I find useful and worth to share with the rest of the world.
